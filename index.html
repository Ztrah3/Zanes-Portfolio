            <h3 class="about-story">MY TRANSITION FROM A HEALTHCARE CAREER TO BECOMING A SELF-TAUGHT WEB DEVELOPER HAS
                EQUIPPED ME
                WITH A
                DISTINCTIVE SKILL SET, MARKED BY ADAPTABILITY AND AN UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO CONTINUOUS LEARNING AND
                GROWTH. DURING MY SIX-YEAR TENURE WITH RENOWNED HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE MAYO CLINIC, I
                HONED
                ESSENTIAL SKILLS IN COMMUNICATION, TEAMWORK, AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WHILE I INITIALLY PURSUED THIS PATH
                UNDER
                PARENTAL PRESSURE, I SOON RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR ALIGNMENT BETWEEN MY CAREER AND GENUINE INTERESTS. MY
                ENTRY INTO CODING AND WEB DEVELOPMENT WAS INSPIRED BY ITS CREATIVE AND PROBLEM-SOLVING ASPECTS. OVER THE
                PAST YEAR, I'VE CULTIVATED MY SKILLS AS A SELF-TAUGHT WEB DEVELOPER, WITH A FOCUS ON FRONT-END
                DEVELOPMENT
                AND MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE WITH FULL-STACK DEVELOPMENT. THIS JOURNEY HAS ENABLED ME TO HARNESS MY NATURAL
                CURIOSITY, PROBLEM-SOLVING MINDSET, AND UNWAVERING DEDICATION TO A CAREER I'M GENUINELY PASSIONATE
                ABOUT. MY
                HEALTHCARE EXPERIENCE HAS INGRAINED IN ME A ROBUST WORK ETHIC, METICULOUS ATTENTION TO DETAIL, AND AN
                UNWAVERING DEDICATION TO ACHIEVING TANGIBLE RESULTS. COUPLED WITH MY TECHNICAL SKILLS, THESE QUALITIES
                POSITION ME AS A VERSATILE CANDIDATE READY TO EXCEL IN A DYNAMIC, FAST-PACED ENVIRONMENT. I AM EXCITED
                ABOUT
                THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE MY EXPERTISE THROUGHOUT A NEW CAREER AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER DEVELOPERS
                TO
                CREATE INNOVATIVE, USER-CENTRIC WEB SOLUTIONS. I AM CONFIDENT THAT MY UNIQUE JOURNEY, PASSION FOR
                CODING,
                AND HUNGER TO LEARN WILL BRING A FRESH PERSPECTIVE TO ANY PROJECT I WORK ON. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE
                TIME
                TO VIEW MY WORK. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCUSSING HOW MY BACKGROUND AND SKILLS CAN ALIGN
                WITH
                THE GOALS AND VISION OF YOUR NEXT PROJECT.</h3>
